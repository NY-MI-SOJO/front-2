<p className="p-content">A community forum titled “Caregiving in Communities of Color” was hosted at the Rochester, N.Y., Democrat and Chronicle in January 2020. It featured a 16-person panel of caregivers and caregiving experts. Executive Editor Michael Kilian wrote a column outlining four primary facts that emerged to help guide our coverage.
People from every walk of life in our society become a caregiver for a loved one. Even nurses. Even nonprofit leaders. Even experts on memory care.
The challenges facing family members when a parent or sibling loses the ability to function fully are universal across lines of income, education, geography and race.
Yet those challenges are far more acute among communities of color, which historically have not accessed available services for reasons ranging from cultural tradition to discrimination.
And in any family, women bear the burden of caregiving far more than men.

A virtual forum was hosted by the Democrat and Chronicle the following June to explore challenges of caregiving exacerbated by the pandemic. 
“Much has changed in caregiving, of course, as it has in every other walk of life since the coronavirus outbreak began. The panelists gave testimony on the even-higher hurdles raised in the COVID-19 era by isolation, by misinformation, by stress and by lack of access to the Internet and transportation,” Kilian said. 
“And then nearly 75 minutes in, the dots connected. In so many words, the discussion pointed to how the needs of Black and Latino caregivers reflect the racial inequities that have prompted tens of thousands of Americans to take to the streets in protest since the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis on Memorial Day.”
