          <h1 id="our-mission">Our Mission</h1>
          <p className="p-content">The New York &amp; Michigan Solutions Journalism Collaborative (NYMI SOJO) is a group of news, 
          education and media outlets pooling time, talent and resources to cover chronic problems with a solutions lens. 
          It is modeled on other successful news collaboratives supported by the Solutions Journalism Network.</p>
          <p className="p-content">Our inaugural project, Invisible Army: Caregiving on the Front Lines, will produce 
          rigorous reporting on successful responses to challenges experienced by caregivers and older adults. </p>

        </section>
        <section>        <h1 id="funding">Funding</h1>
          <p className="p-content">The series on caregivers is made possible through a grant from the <a href="https://www.ralphcwilsonjrfoundation.org/" target="_blank" tag="nymisojo.com">Ralph C. Wilson, Jr. Foundation</a>. 
          The foundation makes grants in the Western New York and Southeast Michigan regions, honoring Wilson&#39;s connections to both Buffalo and Detroit.</p>
          <p className="p-content">The goal of the collaborative is to provide an essential addition to the media landscape that 
          will grow to include other media organizations and become self-sustaining.  We believe a collaboration between these 
          partner organizations across platforms, audiences and sizes will strengthen the local and regional media’s capacity to 
          cover issues of greatest concern.  It will also strengthen the media’s capability to engage meaningfully with the audiences they serve. </p>
          <p className="p-content">The collaborative is a nonpartisan news organization committed to transparency and editorial 
          independence. We do not support or advocate for any particular idea, model, organization, or agenda. </p>

        <section>        <h1 id="how-it-all-started">How It All Started</h1>
          <p className="p-content">The collaborative launched in Western New York in May 2020 after the concept of 
          using solutions journalism to cover the topic of caregiving was tested by the Rochester, N.Y. Democrat 
          and Chronicle through a grant from the Ralph C. Wilson, Jr. Foundation. We thank Executive Editor Michael Kilian for his leadership on the pilot project.  </p>
          <p className="p-content">A similar group of media outlets and community partners teamed up in Southeast 
          Michigan the following September.  The two regional collaboratives joined forces in April 2021 to form 
          the Solutions Journalism Network’s first interstate collaborative.</p>

, a student at the Rochester Institute of Technology, through a co-op with the Democrat and Chronicle and the New York &amp; 
          Michigan Solutions Journalism Collaborative. RIT and the Democrat and Chronicle are members of the collaborative.
